## About

Summarist is a full-stack audiobook summary platform that lets users discover, save, and listen to condensed book summaries. It's built around the idea that key insights from non-fiction books shouldn't require hours of listening: Summarist surfaces the core ideas in a fraction of the time.

The app features a curated home feed with selected, recommended, and suggested books, a personal library where users can track saved and finished titles, and a fully functional in-browser audio player. Authentication supports email/password, Google OAuth, and a guest demo mode, making it easy for anyone to explore without committing to an account.

Subscriptions are gated at the content level: some books require a premium plan to access. Payments are handled through Stripe via the Firebase `firestore-stripe-payments` extension, which manages checkout sessions, customer portals, and subscription status entirely through Firestore listeners. The architecture keeps the frontend thin by delegating all book data to Firebase Cloud Functions and all payment logic to the Stripe extension.

> This project was bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and built out into a production-grade application on top of that foundation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- A Firebase project with:
  - Authentication enabled (Email/Password + Google providers)
  - Firestore database
  - Cloud Functions deployed (the Summarist book API)
  - `firestore-stripe-payments` extension installed
- A Stripe account connected to the Firebase extension

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/summarist.git
cd summarist
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root with your Firebase project credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev      # development server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build
npm run lint     # run ESLint
```

## Architecture / How It Works

### Auth Flow

Auth state is initialized once at the app root via `AuthProvider`, which calls `initAuth()` on mount. This sets up a Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener that writes the user object into a Zustand store (`authStore`). Any component can read `user`, `subscriptionStatus`, or call `openModal()` from the store without prop drilling. `user === undefined` means auth is still resolving (show skeletons); `user === null` means logged out.

### Subscription Status

When a user logs in, `fetchSubscription()` queries the `customers/{uid}/subscriptions` Firestore collection for an active or trialing subscription. It reads the billing interval from the first subscription item to determine the plan tier: yearly → `"premium-plus"`, monthly → `"premium"`, none → `"basic"`. This status gates content access across book detail and player pages.

### Book Data

Books come from an external Firebase Cloud Functions API. The frontend fetches directly from this endpoint: there is no Next.js API layer. Audio durations are computed client-side by loading each audio URL into an HTML `Audio` element and reading `duration`.

### Payments

Stripe checkout is triggered by writing a document to `customers/{uid}/checkout_sessions` in Firestore. The `firestore-stripe-payments` Firebase extension picks this up, creates the Stripe session, and writes the checkout URL back to the document. The client listens for that field to appear and then redirects the user. The Stripe customer portal works similarly via a callable Cloud Function.

### Library Persistence

User library state (saved books, finished books) is stored in Firestore at `users/{uid}/library/saved` and `users/{uid}/library/finished` as arrays of book IDs. All reads and writes happen directly from the client using the Firebase SDK.
